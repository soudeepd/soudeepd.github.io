<br> I am an Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences and Young Faculty 
<br> Research Chair at <a href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/user/196/soudeep-deb">Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore</a>. 
<br> Before joining IIMB, I worked as Senior Lead Data Scientist at
<br> <a href="http://www.nbcuniversal.com/">NBC Universal Media, LLC</a>. In August 2018, I completed my Ph.D. in 
<br> Statistics from the University of Chicago.
<br> 
<br> My primary field of work is related to forecasting, time series 
<br> data, spatio-temporal modeling, inference for random processes. 
<br> I am also interested in sports analytics, especially problems 
<br> related to soccer.
<br>
<br> Previously, I studied at the Indian Statistical Institute, 
<br> where I completed my Bachelor's degree (in 2011), and Master's  
<br> degree (in 2013) in Statistics.
