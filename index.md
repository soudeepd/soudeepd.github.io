<br> I am currently working as Senior Lead Data Scientist at
<br> <a href="http://www.nbcuniversal.com/">NBC Universal Media, LLC</a>. In August 2018, I completed  
<br> my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Chicago.
<br> 
<br> My primary field of work is related to forecasting, 
<br> time series data, spatio-temporal modeling, inference
<br> for random processes. I am also interested in sports
<br> analytics, especially problems related to soccer.
<br>
<br> Previously, I studied at the Indian Statistical 
<br> Institute, where I completed my Bachelor's degree 
<br> (in 2011), and Master's degree (in 2013) in Statistics.
