<br> I am an Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences at <a href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/user/196/soudeep-deb" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Management Bangalore</a> (IIMB). I joined in March 2020 and have got the tenure in October 2023. Before joining IIMB, I worked as Senior Lead Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.nbcuniversal.com/" target="_blank">NBC Universal Media, LLC</a>. In August 2018, I finished my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Chicago. Earlier, I studied at Indian Statistical Institute, completing my Bachelor's (in 2011), and Master's (in 2013) in Statistics. My primary field of work is related to forecasting, time series data, spatio-temporal modeling, inference for random processes, nonparametric methods. I am also interested in sports analytics, especially problems related to soccer. Please find my CV <a href="https://soudeepd.github.io/Resume/CV_DebSoudeep.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (last updated on 19th February 2024).

<br>
  <br> <b> Book update: </b> Recently, I have published my first book (coauthored with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddey07/" target="_blank">Debangan Dey</a>). The book is available on <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Mathematical-Techniques-Competitive-Examinations-Debangan/dp/9393330107/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1674030582&refinements=p_27%3ASoudeep+Deb+Debangan+Dey&s=books&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/mathematical-techniques-competitive-examinations/p/itm8009e4d01f123" target="_blank">Flipkart</a>. It is a problem-based book aimed at high-school students interested in mathematical topics related to the ISI and CMI entrance tests as well as Mathematics Olympiads. In addition to the textbooks, this would be a helpful resource to understand how to tackle complicated problems from topics such as number theory, combinatorics, algebra, calculus, Euclidean and coordinate geometry, probability and statistics. We provide several problem-solving strategies and pointers to help students become confident in advanced high school mathematics.
