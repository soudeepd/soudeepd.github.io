<br> I am an Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences and   
<br> Young Faculty Research Chair at <a href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/user/196/soudeep-deb" target="_blank">IIM Bangalore</a>. Before 
<br> joining IIMB, I worked as Senior Lead Data Scientist at 
<br> <a href="http://www.nbcuniversal.com/" target="_blank">NBC Universal Media, LLC</a>. In August 2018, I finished my 
<br> Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Chicago. Earlier, 
<br> I studied at Indian Statistical Institute, completing my 
<br> Bachelor's (in 2011), and Master's (in 2013) in Statistics.
<br> 
<br> My primary field of work is related to forecasting, 
<br> time series data, spatio-temporal modeling, inference 
<br> for random processes. I am also interested in sports 
<br> analytics, especially problems related to soccer.
