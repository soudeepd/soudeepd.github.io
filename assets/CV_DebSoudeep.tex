In this study, we improve existing methods to use moment closure approximations under normality assumption to solve the system for any order moment of the state at any time-point. Then, we devised new methods to do the same under Poisson assumption.

We demonstrate how the parameters can be marginalized out via the innovation theorem for counting processes. We also provide analytical results for biologically relevant parameter distributions and show how inference can be performed within the marginal process framework.

We applied all our theoretical methods to a simulated dataset to show that the methods are appropriate. Later, the methods were applied to a real-life dataset to find the relationship between individuals.
