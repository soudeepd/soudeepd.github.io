### <a name="upcoming"></a>Services

In academia, it is an important commitment to provide professional services. I have recently been inducted into the editorial board of <a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors#climate-change" target="_blank">Scientific Reports</a>, which is one of the highest-cited journal in the world and is published by the Nature portfolio. I will work as an Associate Editor of the Climate Change division, and am looking forward to the new role.

Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for many journals including the following:
- Biometrics
- BMC Public Health
- Electronic Journal of Statistics
- IIMB Management Review
- Indian Journal of Science and Technology
- Journal of Advances in Management Research
- Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance
- Journal of Multivariate Analysis
- Journal of Sports Analytics
- Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A and Series C
- Linear Algebra and its Applications
- Sankhya A and Sankhya B
- Scientific Reports
- Statistics and Probability Letters
