### <a name="editors"></a>Services

In academia, it is an important commitment to provide professional services. I am currently in the editorial boards of the following journals and I work to the best of my abilities to maintain the high standards of these journals. 

- <a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/about/editors#climate-change" target="_blank">Nature Scientific Reports</a>: Published by the Nature portfolio, it is one of the highest-cited journal in the world. I am working as an Associate Editor of their Climate Change division.
- <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/SAN" target="_blank">Journal of Sports Analytics</a>: One of the pioneering journals in the field of sports analytics. I am working as an Associate Editor for this journal.
- <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/13571" target="_blank">Sankhya B</a>: The Indian Journal of Statistics: It is a quarterly journal from the Indian Statistical Institute, focusing on Applied and Interdisciplinary Statistics including Data Science. I am working as an Associate Editor for this journal.

Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for many journals including the following (in alphabetical order):
- Annals of Applied Statistics
- Biometrics
- BMC Public Health
- Electronic Journal of Statistics
- IIMB Management Review
- Indian Journal of Science and Technology
- Journal of Advances in Management Research
