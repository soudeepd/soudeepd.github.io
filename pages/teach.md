### <a name="assistant"></a>At IIM Bangalore

* (Ongoing) Jan 2023 to Mar 2023: FPM Term 3 - Multivariate Statistics. This is a core course for the PhD students in the Decision Sciences area. Good understanding of probability theory, statistical inference, and linear algebra serve as adequate prerequisites to this course. The syllabus of the course includes the study of random vectors and associated probability distributions, inference about multivariate mean and dispersion matrix, multivariate regression models and dimension reduction techniques. [Send an email](mailto:soudeep@iimb.ac.in) if you want more information.

* Jun 2022 to Sep 2022: PGP Term 1 - Decision Sciences 1. This course is aimed towards MBA students and is a core course in their curriculum. The course is oriented towards application rather than theoretical aspects. It is designed to enable students to conduct data analytics through statistical methods and make data driven inference as well as to help them develop understanding of the methodology, the assumptions made in the process, so as to be able to tweak them, depending on ground realities. [Send an email](mailto:soudeep@iimb.ac.in) if you want more information.

* May 2022: Pre-doctoral program - Research Methodology. It is a mandatory and introductory course for incoming pre-doctoral students at IIMB. In this short course, basic concepts of probability and statistics, data summarization and visualization, along with their usefulness in research problems are taught.

* Jan 2022 to Mar 2022: FPM Term 3 - Multivariate Statistics. This course is designed for PhD students with a background on probability theory and statistical inference. It is a core course for doctoral students in the Decision Sciences Area at IIMB. See above for the course description.

* Jul 2021 to Sep 2021: PGP Term 1 - Decision Sciences 1. This course is aimed towards MBA students and is a core course in their curriculum. See above for the course description.

* Oct 2020 to Dec 2020: FPM Term 2 - Statistical Inference. It is a core course for the PhD students in the Decision Sciences area. The main aim is to provide a solid foundation in Statistics to the students intending to carry out dissertation with strong quantitative orientation. This course assumes basic knowledge of Statistics and builds on the probability theory course offered for the same group of students in term 1. The course is designed to be theoretical in nature, but due emphasis for numerical implementation is also given, primarily using R.
