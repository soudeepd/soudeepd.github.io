I am currently working as Associate Professor and the Chairperson of Decision Sciences Area at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore. My primary research interests are time series data, spatio-temporal modeling, spatial statistics and inference for random processes. I am also interested in the application of statistics in sports, especially soccer. Before this, I worked as Senior Lead Data Scientist in NBC Universal Media, LLC., in New York.

I got my PhD in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 2018, working under the guidance of [Dr Wei Biao Wu]{https://stat.uchicago.edu/people/profile/wei-biao-wu/}. Previously, in 2011, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at the Indian Statistical Institute. In 2013, I completed my Master's degree in Statistics from the same university, with a specialization in Mathematical Statistics and Probability. For my Master's thesis, I worked on Association Analyses for Identifying Rare Genetic Variants with [Dr. Saurabh Ghosh](http://www.isical.ac.in/~saurabh/).
