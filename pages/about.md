I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Statistics, University of Chicago, and am working towards my Ph.D. thesis under the direction of [Professor Wei Biao Wu](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~wbwu/). My primary research interests are time series data, spatio-temporal modeling, spatial statistics and inference for random processes. I am also interested in the application of statistics in sports, especially soccer.

Previously, in 2011, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at the Indian Statistical Institute. In 2013, I completed my Master's degree in Statistics from the same university, with a specialization in Mathematical Statistics and Probability. For my Master's thesis, I worked on Association Analyses for Identifying Rare Genetic Variants with [Dr. Saurabh Ghosh](http://www.isical.ac.in/~saurabh/).

Here is a link to my [curriculum vitae](/assets/CV_DebSoudeep.pdf).
