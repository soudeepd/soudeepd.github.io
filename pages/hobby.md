### <a name="travel"></a>Travel

I am an avid traveler, and have traveled to 26 countries from six continents so far. Here are some useful links for people like me.

* [Couchsurfing](https://coucusurfing.com/): This is the best way to meet local people if you are going to a new place. Stay with someone for free, get useful information about exciting places to visit and make the best out of your trip. Especially, if you are a solo traveler, you will find it to be the best networking site ever. [[My Couchsurfing profile]](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/soudeep-deb)

* [Instagram](http://instagram.com): It goes without saying that a trip is incomplete without some spectacular photos. And Instagram might be the best platform in this matter. Search for relevant places and hashtags before going to a new place, check out cool photos to get yourself more excited, and be more prepared for an amazing photographic expedition.

* [Build your own map](https://soudeep.shinyapps.io/World-Scratch-Map/): Who does not want to show off to friends and relatives? Using this app (I am still working on this to make it faster and better), you can make your own mark in the world. Go to this website, select the places you have visited so far, and voila - you get a map like the following.

### <a name="blog"></a>Blogging

I have been writing since my childhood, although I have not been much productive in recent years. Still, in my leisure hours, I am trying to maintain the habit as much as I can.

* [My travel stories](https://songsofroad.com/): In May 2019, I have finally managed to start this blog, to keep all the stories from my trips in one place. It also contains a selected collection of my favourite photos from different times.

* [Personal blog](http://soudeepd.blogspot.com): This is the place where I scribble other stuff, mostly in Bengali, from time to time.

* [Chorjapod](http://chorjapod.com/author/pagladashu/): If you love to read or write Bengali piecese, please visit this website. It is one of the best online blogging community ever.
