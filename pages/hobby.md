### <a name="travel"></a>Travel

I am an avid traveler, and have traveled to 18 countries from six continents so far. Here are some useful links to people like me.

* [Couchsurfing](https://coucusurfing.com/): This is the best way to meet local people if you are going to a new place. Stay with someone for free, get useful information about exciting places to visit and make the best out of your trip. Especially, if you are a solo traveler, you will find it to be the best networking site ever. [[My Couchsurfing profile]]

* [Chicago Academic Achievement Program](https://caap.uchicago.edu/).

* [Instagram](http://instagram.com): It goes without saying that a trip is incomplete without some spectacular photos. And Instagram might be the best platform in this matter. Search for relevant places and hashtags before going to a new place, and check out cool photos to get yourself more excited, and more prepared for an amazing photographic expedition.

* [Make a map]: Who does not want to show off to friends and relatives? Here is a cool website to make your own mark in the world. Go to this website, select the places you have visited so far, and voila - you get a map like the following. 

### <a name="blog"></a>Blogging

I have been writing since my childhood, although I have not been much productive in recent years. Still, in my leisure hours, I am trying to maintain the habit as much as I can.

* [Stories from Africa](http://galton.uchicago.edu/faculty/barber.shtml): This was my travel story ever, after I visited Masai Mara in Kenya. It was one of my dream destinations and I finally managed to visit the place in February, 2017. 

* [Personal blog](http://soudeepd.blogspot.com): This is the place where I scribble stuff from time to time.

* [Chorjapod](http://chorjapod.com/author/pagladashu/): If you love to read or write Bengali piecese, please visit this website. It is one of the best online blogging community ever.
