### Overview: 

Primarily, I work on different aspects of time series and spatial data. Often, the theory and methods I work on are inspired from real life problems from different disciplines, ranging from climate to public health to finance to social sciences. Following are broadly the topics I have been working on.

- Spatio-temporal modeling 
- Quantile regression and extreme value in time series and spatial data
- Categorical and discrete time series data
- Clustering and classification methods
- Bayesian implementation of time series methods
- Application of statistics in sports, especially soccer

### <a name="consulting"></a>Consulting work

With my expertise and experiences in working with real life datasets, I am interested in providing consulting services to relevant industries. I have been doing this in different capacities for a few organizations, as listed below.

- National Foundation for Corporate Governance (NFCG), c/o Confederation of Indian Industry (CII): We are collaborating on a joint analysis of the feedback survey and concurrent evaluation of the pilot project of the Prime Minister Internship Scheme in India.

- Real Estate Research Initiative (IIMB-RERI), Bengaluru, India: It is an ongoing collaborative venture. In one of our recently concluded projects, we worked on a spatial modelling technique to create a commercial rental index that can be used for understanding the dynamics of rental properties in various cities of India.

- Smart City Mission, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, India: As part of the SAAR-Sameeksha series, we are focusing on three smart cities to understand whether the introduction of smart classrooms has improved the quality of education, especially in terms of reducing dropout rates for poor children.

- DBS Bank, Singapore: This work is related to a three-step methodology utilized by the client for understanding the value of data in banking industry. We reviewed their method and provided theoretical as well as empirical understanding of the efficacy of the currently used methodology. It was followed up with necessary modifications and suggestions.

- SportsKPI, Bengaluru, India: Kabaddi is a popular sport in India, with a cash-rich national league system played across various cities. The client deals with multiple aspects of the league for several teams. In this collaborative work, we developed a method for appropriate valuation of a Kabaddi player and how it can be used in building strategies, both during auction stage and the matches.
