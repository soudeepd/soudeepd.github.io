### Overview: 

Primarily, I work on different aspects of time series and spatial data. Often, the theory and methods I work on are inspired from real life problems from different disciplines, ranging from climate to public health to finance to social sciences. Following are broadly the topics I have been working on.

- Categorical and discrete time series data
- Spatio-temporal modeling 
- Clustering and classification methods
- Bayesian implementation of time series methods
- Application of statistics in sports, especially soccer
